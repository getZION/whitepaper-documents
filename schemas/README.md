# Schemas

These are a work in progress. There may be more.

The schemas of the data coming out of the DWN (through hooks or queries) should relate to schema.org schemas as closely as possible.

We will call them zion.fyi/SchemaName for the time being, but we should stay as close as possible to something that's generally available through schema.org.

- [COMMUNITY](COMMUNITY.md)
- [PERSON](PERSON.md)
- [POST](POST.md)
- [COMMENT](COMMENT.md)
- [USER INTERACTION](USERINTERACTION.md)
- [IMAGE](IMAGE.md)
- [VIDEO](VIDEO.md)
- [DATETIME](DATETIME.md)

Within DWN we will be storing the following schemas in Collections, the rest can just be fully within the parent schema:

- Person
- Community
- Post
- Comment
- UserInteraction
